=== Sketchy PDE-Constrained Optimization

This is my current research in collaboration with [https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/ Prof. Madeleine Udell] and [https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?dpkouri Dr. Drew Kouri]. 

PDE-Constrained Optimization is often bottlenecked by the storage requirements and our work aims to rectify this by developing novel low memory optimzation algorithms.  

== Software Projects
=== *Presolve Routines for Optimization Problems*

This was a [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/ Google Summer of Code 2016] project under Julia-Opt under the supervision of Prof. Madeleine Udell. 

Currently the [[https://github.com/ramcha24/Presolve package] contains an implementation of LP Presolving based on ideas from [http://www.turma-aguia.com/davi/doc/Andersen.pdf Andersen & Andersen paper] and the GLPK solver.
Presolving removes redundancies from the original problem given by the user and constructs a smaller equivalent problem which is then fed to the solver
=== Data Driven Discovery

I'm a part of the Cornell contingent to the [https://gitlab.com/datadrivendiscovery Data Driven Discovery] Project developing a python wrapper for [https://github.com/madeleineudell/LowRankModels.jl LowRankModels.jl]
