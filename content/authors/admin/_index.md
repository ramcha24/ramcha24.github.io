I am a fifth year PhD Student in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Jeremias Sulam. My work explores theoretical questions in evaluating machine learning models,
- Generalization : performance on unseen data,
- Robustness : performance on corrupted data. 

Accounting for local sensitivity of models typically yield tighter theoretical guarantees. The characterization of local sensitivity often relies on underlying parsimony.


Prior to starting my graduate studies, I was a research assistant at Cornell University supervised by Dr. Madeleine Udell. At Ithaca, I worked on developing low-memory algorithms for PDE-optimization based on randomized sketching.
